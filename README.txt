	CW1 - make front end.
	CW2 - add a database, and connect it with PHP.

Year 2 - Semester 1.
====================

Web development
	CW1 - make backend in servlets/jsps.
	CW2 - make backend in php or python.

Data structures and algorithms
	CW1 - build hashmaps from scratch and then use it to make a spellchecker application.
	CW2 - use the graphs library.

Programming languages
	labs for SML (Standard Meta Language of New Jersey), python and prolog.

Year 2 - Semester 2.
