			<h1>Real Time Strategies.</h1>
			<p>These days it's a rather dead genre. It first apperead in 1992
				in a game called Dune II, by Westwood Studios. The same company
				later created Command & Conquer. There were other contributors to
				that genre, like Blizzard's Warcraft and Starcraft, and Ensemble
				studios' Age of Empires. These are the holy father, son and the
				ghost of real time strategies, but there are more. There is Total
				Anniliation, which takes RTS to an encredible scale. There is
				Stronghold, which combines the mechanics of city builders and tower
				defense. There are games like Rise of Nations or Empire Earth that
				follow the evolution of human kind from the very dawn to modern
				times.</p>
			<p>Personally, i started playing those in a very early age. My
				first was Age of Empires 2, but i have played all of above
				mentioned. Maybe not all in that franchise, but at least a fraction
				for sure. For me, these games felt like playing with toy soldiers.
				It wasn't really about strategy per se. In fact, if you were to boil
				it all down to just that, then the genre becomes really stiff, since
				the only viable strategy in those games is hoarding workers.</p>
			<p>I am afraid that because of that the genre been dying. It's
				taken too seriously, even though a lot of the games in the genre are
				casual. The same tactics of rushing and hoarding workers are used
				universary in any RTS. In fact, one of my favourite strategy games
				is Age of Empires 1, due to having a 50 population limit. What might have been a technical limitation at the time, has become a
				great mechanic, that forces you to balance the amount of workers and soldiers you have.</p>
